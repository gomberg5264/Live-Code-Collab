# Live-Code-Collab
>RealTime Code collaboration platform 
Collab with your friends, colleagues and code together in realtime!. 

sYou can use it to conduct interviews, help your friend debug some code, explaining the working of a code and much more. Basically it makes learning programming together much easy and fun!.

For implementing the concurrent edits and realtime colaboration I have used `Operational Transformations` and `socket.io` for chatting and syncing the code file
